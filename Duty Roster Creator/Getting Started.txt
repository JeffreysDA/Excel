The Duty Roster Creator is comprised of several excel files that work together and are dependent upon each other.
Compatibility: Microsoft Office 2013 and newer. (Untested, but might work with older versions)


REQUIRED FILES:
The Primary file is the 'Able Body Report Roster.xlsm' (ABRR). The ABRR is the powerhouse behind the other files and is the bulk of this tool.
It requires the '2_TEMPLATES' folder and all of its contents to properly work. The files can work from almost any location, but may have issues 
if used from a network drive (Share drive, OneNote, etc.). Aside from ensuring that you have the ABRR, and the '2_TEMPLATES' folder (with all of its contents)
the only other requirement is that the file structure remain the same. This just means that the ABRR and the '2_TEMPLATES' folder need to be located in the same spot.
This also means that the files cannot be renamed.

If changes need to be made to the Duty Roster Creator. Use the 'Developer Mode' feature to make your changes. See the 'Documents' repository for detailed instructions
on how to access 'Developer Mode'.



NOT REQUIRED, BUT USEFUL:
The ABRR imports documents to better determine how to do its calculations and help ensure it is as accurate as possible. Examples of these files can be found in the
'1_EXAMPLES' folder. The '1_EXAMPLES' folder is not required in order for the Duty Roster Creator to work, but rather to give the user an idea of what the imported documents
should look like, how they should be named, and how they should be structured internally. Likewise, the instruction manuals for the ABRR and the Duty Roster are not
required, but will help give the users a better understanding of each function and feature, and how to use it to its full capabilities.
